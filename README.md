# Insert Gifs right from the composer
![demo](http://i.giphy.com/3o6ZtpW8MROd9L1Dqg.gif)

This NodeBB plugin allows posters to search for an insert gifs from Giphy right in the composer.

It works just like mentions, except you use an ampersand (`&`) and start typing a word or phrase that you want to search for.
Click on one, and the image is automatically embedded into the post.

If you start running into rate limits, i.e. you're a high-traffic forum and some requests aren't completing, you may need to [get your own API key](https://api.giphy.com/submit).

## Installation

Search for "giphy" in the Nodebb Plugins list, or

    npm install nodebb-plugin-giphy
